# Using CSC Environment Efficiently

# Note! This repository is a work in progress

## Opening target is Q1 2021

This repository holds the source for the lectures, tutorials and exercises
for facilitating the efficient use of the CSC computational resources.
The content is designed as modular blocks that can be easily embedded
in training materials in universities, CSC's own training events or
any courses which touch topics where CSC resources can be used.

You are [welcome to contribute](./contribute_guide/README.md) to the 
content via fork and pull request!

The **slides** folder contains an introduction to each of the topics as a
separate slideset.
The **hands-on** folder has subfolders with more descriptive names containing
**tutorials** (a copy/paste walkthrough) for each of slideset topics and also
**exercises** (tasks with instructions themed by scientific disciplines).
