# Comments

- A word beginning with `#` causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.

```bash
$ echo "Have a nice day!"   # Yes, indeed
$ #rm -rf Documents
```

- Exception: if commands are read from a file beginning with `#!`, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Have a nice day!'
# Yes, indeed
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
from datetime import datetime
print "Today is", datetime.now()
```


# Parameters

- A _parameter_ is an entity that stores values. A _variable_ is a parameter denoted by a name.
  - In common speak, terms _parameter_ and _variable_ are interchangeable, but they are very different beings; parameters are set only by the shell, variables are user settable.

```bash
name=[value]
```

- A parameter (or variable) is set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is also a valid value.


# Parameter expansion

- The `$` character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.
- The basic form of parameter expansion is `${parameter}`. The value of _parameter_ is substituted.
  - The braces are required when _parameter_ is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when _parameter_ is followed by a character that is not to be interpreted as part of its name.

```bash
$ echo $HOME   # ——> echo /home/cscuser
$ echo ${HOME}s   # ——> echo /home/cscusers
```


# Parameter expansion, substring expansion

```bash
$ echo ${string:-bummer}   # ––> echo bummer
$ echo ${string:=0123456789abcdefgh}   # ––> string=0123456789abcdefgh; echo 0123456789abcdefgh
$ echo ${string:7}   # ––> echo 7890abcdefgh
$ echo ${string: -7}   # ––> echo bcdefgh (note the space before -)
$ echo ${string:7:2}   # ––> echo bc
$ echo ${!HO*}   # ––> echo HOME HOSTNAME HOSTTYPE
$ echo ${#HOME}   # ––> echo 13
$ echo ${HOME#/home}   # ––> echo /cscuser
$ echo ${HOME%user}   # ––> echo /home/csc
$ echo ${HOME^^}   # ––> echo /HOME/CSCUSER
$ echo ${HOME^^e}   # ––> echo /homE/cscusEr
```

```bash
$ echo $PATH; echo ${PATH/usr/abc}
$ echo $PATH; echo ${PATH//usr/abc}
$ echo $PATH; echo ${PATH//usr/}
$ echo $PATH; echo ${PATH//\/usr/}
```


# Positional parameters

- _Positional parameters_ are assigned from the command's arguments when it is invoked.
- A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0.
- Positional parameter _n_ may be referenced as `${n}`, or as `$n` when _n_ consists of a single digit.

```bash
$ mkdir -p one two/three   # ––> command="mkdir", $1="-p", $2="one", $3="two/three"
```


# Special parameters

- `$@` expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.
- `$#` expands to the number of positional parameters.
- `$?` expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- `$!` expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background.
- `$$` expands to the process ID of the shell.
- `$0` Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.


# Command substitution

- Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself.

```bash
$ list=$(ls exp)
$ echo $list
```

- Old-style backquote form is still in use, but it's usage is strongly discouraged.

```bash
$ list=`ls exp`
$ echo $list
```


# Arithmetic expansion

- Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is: `$(( expression ))`

```bash
$ echo $(( 1+2*3**4 ))
```

- Supports only integers and (some of the) valid operators are:
  - exponentiation "`**`";
  - multiplication "`*`", division "`/`", remainder "`%`";
  - addition "`+`" and subtraction "`-`";
  - comparisons "`<= => < >`", equality "`==`" and inequality "`!=`"; and
  - bitwise AND "`&`", XOR "`^`" and OR "`|`", and logical AND "`&&`" and OR "`||`".


# Lists of commands

- A _list_ is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the list operators.
  - Commands separated by a `;` are executed sequentially.
  - Commands separated by `&` are executed asynchronously.

```bash
$ ls; echo "Hello there!"
$ ls & echo "Hello there!"
```

- AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more comands separated by the control operators `&&` and `||`, respectively.
  - `command1 && command2`: _command2_ is executed if _command1_ succeeds.
  - `command1 || command2`: _command2_ is executed if _command1_ fails.

```bash
$ mkdir foo && echo "Success"
$ mkdir foo || echo "Fail"
```


# Compound commands

- Compound commands are the shell programming language constructs.
- Each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator.
- Bash provides conditional constructs, looping constructs, and mechanisms to group commands and execute them as a unit.


# Conditional constructs

- The syntax of the if command is:<br/>
`if` _test-commands_`; then`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_consequent-commands_`;`<br/>
`[elif` _more-test-commands_`; then`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_more-consequents_`;]`<br/>
`[else`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_alternate-consequents_`;]`<br/>
`fi`


# Conditional expressions

- The _test-commands_ often involves numerical or string comparison tests, but it can be any command that returns a status of zero when it succeeds, and some other status when it fails.
- Bash provides two comparison expressions:
  - command `test` (and it's synonym `[`), which is more portable but limited in features; and
  - the "new test" command `[[`, which has fewer surprises and is generally safer to use — but works only in Bash.

```bash
$ if [ "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser" ]; then
>    echo 'Good day!';
> fi
```


# Conditional expressions

```bash
$ if [ "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser" ]; then echo 'Good day!'; fi
$ if test "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser"; then echo 'Good day!'; fi
$ test "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser" && echo 'Good day!'
$ [ "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser" ] && echo 'Good day!'

$ if [ "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser" ]; then echo 'Good day!'; else echo 'How do you do!'; fi
$ [ "$LOGNAME" = "cscuser" ] && echo 'Good day!' || echo 'How do you do!'

$ [ -e "Desktop" ] && echo "File Desktop exists."
$ [ "Desktop" -nt "exp" ] && echo "Desktop is newer" || echo "exp is newer"

$ [ $(id -u) -ne $UID ] && echo "User ID's do not match."
$ [ $(( $(id -u) + 1 )) -ne $UID ] && echo "User ID's do not match."

$ if [ -e Desktop -a -d Desktop ]; then echo "Desktop is a directory"; fi
$ [[ -e Desktop && -d Desktop ]] && echo "Desktop is a directory"   # This is similar with [[]]
$ [ -e Desktop && -d Desktop ] && echo "Desktop is a directory"   # This does not work
```


# Looping constructs

- Bash supports the following looping constructs (note that a `;` may be replaced with a newline):
  - `until` _test-commands_ `; do` _consequent-commands_ `; done`<br/>
  Execute _consequent-commands_ as long as _test-commands_ has an exit status which is not zero.
  - `while` _test-commands_`; do` _consequent-commands_`; done`<br/>
  Execute _consequent-commands_ as long as _test-commands_ has an exit status of zero.
  - `for` _name_ `[ [in [`_words …_`] ] ; ] do` _commands_`; done`<br/>
  Expand _words_ and execute _commands_ once for each member in the resultant list, with _name_ bound to the current member.


# Looping constructs

```bash
$ for sqr in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do echo $(( 2 ** $sqr )); done
$ for sqr in {1..6}; do echo $(( 2 ** $sqr)); done
$ for (( sqr = 1; sqr <= 6; sqr++ )); do echo $(( 2 ** $sqr )); done
```

```bash
$ for sqr in {1..6..2}; do echo $(( 2 ** $sqr )); done
```

```bash
$ for i in *; do echo "$i"; done   # Equivalent to 'ls -1'
```

```bash
$ for ns in $(grep ^nameserver /etc/resolv.conf); do
>   if [ $ns = nameserver ]; then continue; fi
>   ping -c1 $ns
> done
$ for ns in "$(grep ^nameserver /etc/resolv.conf)"; do ping -c1 ${ns##nameserver }; done
```

{:.Q}

Avoiding loops: Often you can avoid writing a loop by just realizing that a
command can operate on multiple arguments, such as file names, instead
of just a single one at a time. Can you find such commands?


# Looping constructs

```bash
while read -r line; do
  echo "You typed: $line"
  [ "$line" = "end" ] && break
done
```

```bash
until [ "$line" = "end" ]; do
  read -r line
  echo "You typed: $line"
done
```


# Command grouping

- Bash provides two ways to group a list of commands to be executed as a unit.

  ( _list_ )
    : Placing a _list_ of commands between parentheses causes a subshell environment to be created, and each of the commands in _list_ to be executed in that subshell.

  { _list_; }
    : Placing a _list_ of commands between curly braces causes the _list_ to be executed in the current shell context. The semicolon (or newline) following _list_ is required.

```bash
$ ( echo "Directory listing:"; ls ) > dir_list
```


# Functions

- Shell functions are a way to group commands for later execution using a single name for the group.
- Functions are declared using either of these these syntax:<br/>
_name_ `()` _compound-command_ `[` _redirections_ `]`<br/>
`function` _name_ `[()]` _compound-command_ `[` _redirections_ `]`

- When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution.

```bash
$ ll () { ls -laF "$@" | more; }
```


# Command execution

- When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right.
  1. The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments and redirections are saved for later processing.
  2. The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded. If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the arguments.
  3. Redirections are performed.
  4. The text after the ‘=’ in each variable assignment undergoes expansions.
- If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment. Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed command.


# Exit status

- On UNIX systems, every command must return an exit status value, which is returned to the shell and they fall between 0 and 255.
- For the shell’s purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.
  - If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
  - Generally, an exit status of 2 indicates incorrect usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments.
