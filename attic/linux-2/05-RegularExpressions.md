# Matching text

- A number of Unix text-processing utilities let you search for, and in some cases change, text strings.
  - These utilities include the editing programs `ed`, `ex`, `vi` and `sed`, the `awk` programming language, and the commands `grep` and `egrep`.
- _Regular expressions_ — or _regexes_ for short — are a way to match text with patterns.
- Regular expressions are a pattern matching standard for string parsing and replacement.


# The most simple regex

- In it's simplest form, a regular expression is a string of symbols to match "as is".

  | Regex     |   Matches   |
  |-----------|-------------|
  | `abc`     | **abc**def  |
  | `234`     | 1**234**5   |

```bash
$ grep '234'
```


# Basic regexes vs. extended regexes

- The Basic Regular Expressions or _BRE flavor_ standardizes a flavor similar to the one used by the traditional UNIX `grep` command.
  - The only supported quantifiers are `.` (dot), `^` (caret), `$` (dollar), and `*` (star). To match these characters literally, escape them with a `\` (backslash).
  - Some implementations support `\?` and `\+`, but they are not part of the POSIX standard.
- Most modern regex flavors are extensions to the BRE flavor, thus called _ERE flavor_. By today's standard, the POSIX ERE flavor is rather bare bones.
- We will be using extended regexes, so:

```bash
$ alias grep='grep --color=auto -E'
```


# Quantifiers

- To match several characters you need to use a quantifier:
  - `*` matches any number of what's before it, from zero to infinity.
  - `?` matches zero or one of what's before it.
  - `+` matches one or more of what's before it.

  | Regex     | Matches                         |
  |-----------|---------------------------------|
  | `23*4`    | 1**24**5, 1**234**5, 1**2334**5 |
  | `23?4`    | 1**24**5, 1**234**5             |
  | `23+4`    | 1**234**5, 1**2334**5           |

```bash
$ grep '23*4'
```


# Regexes are hoggish

- By default, regexes are greedy. They match as many characters as possible.

  | Regex     |   Matches   |
  |-----------|-------------|
  | `2`       | 1**2222**3  |

- You can define how many instances of a match you want by using ranges:
  - `{m}` matches only _m_ number of what's before it.
  - `{m,n}` matches _m_ to _n_ number of what's before it (`{0,1}` = `?`).
  - `{m,}` matches _m_ or more number of what's before it (`{1,}`= `+`).


# Special characters

- A lot of special characters are available for regex building. Here are some of the more usual ones:
  - `.` matches any single character.
  - `^` matches the beginning of the input string.
  - `$` matches the end of the input string.
  - `\w` matches an alphanumeric character, `\W` a non-alphanumeric.
  - `\` to escape special characters, e.g. `\.` matches a dot, and `\\` matches a backslash.


# Special character examples

  | Regex     | Matches                      | Does not match       |
  |-----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
  | `1.3`     | **123**4, **1z3**, 0**133**  | 13                   |
  | `1.*3`    | **13**, **123**, **1zdfkj3** |                      |
  | `\w+@\w+` | **a@a**, **email@oy**.ab     | ,.-!"#€%&/           |
  | `^1.*3$`  | **13**, **123**, **1zdfkj3** | x13, 123x, x1zdfkj3x |


# Character classes

- You can group characters by putting them between square brackets. This way, any character in the class will match any *one* character in the input.
  - `[abc]` matches any of a, b, and c.
  - `[a-z]` matches any character between a and z.
    - Note: if you want to include `-` in the matching charaters, add it as the first or last entry in the class, otherwise it will be interpreted as a range definition!
  - `[^abc]` matches anything other than a, b, or c.
    - Note that here the caret `^` at the beginning indicates "not" instead of beginning of line.
  - `[+*?.]` matches any of +, *, ? or the dot.
    - Most special characters have no meaning inside the square brackets.


# Character class examples

  | Regex               | Matches                                        | Does not match    |
  |---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
  | `[^ab]`             | **c**, **d**, ab**c**, **s**a**dv**b**cv**     | a, b, ab          |
  | `^[1-9][0-9]*$`     | **1**, **45**, **101**                         | 0123, -1, a1, 2.0 |
  | `[0-9]*[,.]?[0-9]+` | **1**, **.1**, **0.1**, **1,000**, **0,0,0.0** |                   |


# Grouping and alternatives

- It might be necessary to group things together, which is done with parentheses `(` and `)`.

  | Regex   | Matches                    | Does not match |
  |---------|----------------------------|----------------|
  | `(ab)`  | **ab**, **abab**, a**ab**b | aa, bb         |

  - Grouping itself usually does not do much, but combined with other features turns out to be very useful.
- The OR operator `|` may be used for alternatives.

  | Regex      | Matches                    | Does not match |
  |------------|----------------------------|----------------|
  | `(aa|bb)`  | **aa**, **bbaa**, **aabb** | abab           |


# Subexpressions

- With parentheses, you can also define subexpressions to store the match after it has happened and then refer to it later on.

  | Regex       | Matches                      | Does not match |
  |-------------|------------------------------|----------------|
  | `(ab)\1`    | **abab**cdcd                 | ab, abcabc     |
  | `(ab)c.*\1` | **abcabc**, **abcdefab**cdef | abc, ababc     |


# Some practical (?) examples

- Check for a valid format for email address:

  ```bash
  $ grep '\w[A-Za-z0-9._+-]+[^.]@\w[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}'
  ```

  - `\w[A-Za-z0-9._+-]+[^.]` matches all acceptable characters not starting or ending with a dot.
  - `@` matches the @ sign.
  - `\w[A-Za-z0-9.-]+` matches any domain name, incl. dots.
  - `\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$` matches a literal dot followed by two or more characters at the end.
- Check for a valid format for Finnish social security:
  - Format is `ddmmyyCnnnV`, where `C`=century, and `V`=verify

  ```bash
  $ grep '[0-9]{2}[01][0-9]{3}[-+A][0-9]{3}[ABCDEFHJLKMNPRSTUVWXY]'
  ```
